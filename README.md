A simple rock-paper-scissors game that is played in the developer console of your browser.

This is an assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors)

Initially was played in the console. I have now implemented a very simple UI that you can use to play the game.
